## 🌎 Xcode Projects

Up until now, we've mainly worked in repl.it, which is a great place to run code, but not usable to build real iOS apps. _Xcode Projects_ is a place where we can! A lot more than writing code goes into building an iOS app, but we can do it all in Xcode. It is a big challenge that utilizes a lot of different tools; so we will take it one step at a time. [Here's]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/lessons/storyboard/assets/xcode-map.png) a map of the main features in Xcode.

Your Instructors or IAs can now screenshare and show you the main features highlighted in the map above, or you can watch this video:
