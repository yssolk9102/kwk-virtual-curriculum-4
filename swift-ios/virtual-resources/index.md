## Virtual Camp Norms

### Call Preparation

- Use headphones
- Make sure you have space for your notebook
- Join call 5 minutes before

### During the Call

- For all sessions, we would like you to have your video on
- It is best to keep yourself muted when not speaking
- Use Participant Panel icons
  * Slow down: If the content seems to be moving too fast
  * Raise hand: If you have a question
- Use chat often. Questions should go to the full room
- We welcome any chatter that is on the topic of the lesson

### In Breakout Rooms

- Be mindful of position/power/voice in the call
- Everyone should share their ideas
- Check in with everyone if you haven’t heard from people
- Give wait time before/after you speak
    * It is easy to talk over people in remote settings, if you do, apologize and then let them finish
    * If you are struggling with your internet connection, you can say “DONE” when you are done with your thoughts so no one is confused

### Breaks & Interruptions

- If you need a break, message your instructor, turn off your video and take a break!
- Breaks will be built in to every session
- We know things will happen in remote settings!  Use your mute setting whenever possible and if necessary, turn your video off while dealing with the situation.
- You don’t need to apologize for dogs or background noise, just use the mute button!
