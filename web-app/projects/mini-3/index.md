Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build a small application that gives a user a unique experience based on the information they provide in a form!

You may have seen this type of functionality before. When a site asks you to sign up for a newsletter - you type your email, then see a small message of something like "Thanks for signing up! We'll send a message to _your email address_!"

### Must-Haves

- An explanation of what type of info you want from your user
- At least two inputs and one submit button
- Functionality as follows: when a user enters information and clicks submit, the information they entered appears somewhere in the app

[Here's an example](https://mini-3-example.glitch.me/) (note that you can pick any topic you want for this!):

<img class="small" alt="App asked for name and sign, then included name and sign emoji in a birthday greeting" src="{{ site.url }}/web-app/projects/mini-3/assets/ex-3.png">

### Tips

Follow the iterations closely, and reach out if you are stuck for more than 15 minutes!

## Iteration 1 - Planning

- Decide on topic - what questions will you ask your use? What type of inputs do you want them to provide their answers with?
- Wireframe

## Iteration 2 - Write HTML and CSS

Write the HTML necessary for the form, and any other pieces of content you want on your page. Styling the app with CSS is optional!

## Iteration 3 - Pseudo-Code JS

Before you start writing out JavaScript, take some time to pseudo-code. In your notebook or as comments in the JavaScript file, list out the steps you want to tell your program to take.

## Iteration 4 - Implement JS

Now that you have a plan, write the code to power this functionality
