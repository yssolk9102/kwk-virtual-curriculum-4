## Practice in a Glitch Project

Follow the directions in the Glitch project below to get some practice with accessing elements, changing text and CSS, and event listeners!

You can either type your code in the embedded Glitch project below by clicking "Edit Project", or click the name of the project in the bottom left corner of the project below to open it in another tab and see it full-page. Then, you'll need to Remix it.
